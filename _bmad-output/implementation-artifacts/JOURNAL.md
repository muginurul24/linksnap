### 0.0 — Project Initialized
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 18:30 GMT+7
- **Duration:** Setup session
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Project initialized by Claw Kun. Next.js 16.2.4 + Bun + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components installed. Drizzle ORM schema created (9 tables), NextAuth v5 configured, Upstash Redis client set up. Full dashboard template with sidebar, 9 routes, and comprehensive IMPLEMENTATION.md checklist created. SECURITY.md and mobile implementation plan added.

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — Full Drizzle schema (users, links, linkPages, smartRules, clickEvents, campaigns, splitTests, subscriptions, transactions, settings)
- `src/lib/db/index.ts` — Lazy Neon DB connection
- `src/lib/auth/index.ts` — NextAuth v5 config (Google + Credentials)
- `src/lib/redis/index.ts` — Upstash Redis client
- `src/app/(dashboard)/**` — 9 dashboard pages with full UI
- `src/components/dashboard/**` — AppSidebar + AppHeader
- `src/components/ui/button-link.tsx` — Custom button-link component
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/PRD.md` — 626-line product requirements
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/SECURITY.md` — 16-category security checklist
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION-MOBILE.md` — 24-task mobile plan
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — 54-task web checklist
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — This file
- `AGENTS.md` — Codex instructions (RTK mandatory + BMad process)
- `project-context.md` — Constitution for AI agents

**Decisions Made:**
- Next.js monolith (not microservices) — simpler ops for MVP, split only when 50K+ users
- Drizzle ORM over Prisma — type-safe, lightweight, no codegen
- NextAuth JWT strategy (not database sessions) — avoids adapter schema conflicts
- Lazy DB connection — prevents build-time errors when DATABASE_URL not set
- shadcn/ui v4 with Base UI — modern, accessible component library
- Bun as package manager — faster than npm/pnpm

**Tests:**
- ⬜ Pending — tests will be written per task

**Issues Encountered:**
- `asChild` prop not supported in shadcn v4 Button/DropdownMenuItem — resolved by creating custom `ButtonLink` component and using plain `<a>` tags instead
- `delayDuration` prop removed from TooltipProvider in newer shadcn — resolved by using default
- recharts `createContext` error in server components — resolved by adding `"use client"` directive to pages using charts

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ All API inputs to be validated with Zod (schemas defined)
- ✅ JWT httpOnly cookies configured
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs
- ✅ Rate limiting strategy documented in SECURITY.md

**Next Task:** Phase 0.1 — Environment Setup (fill .env variables)

### 0.1 — Environment Setup
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 19:44 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 35 minutes
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial

**What I Did:**
Created the local `.env` file from the project template. `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, app URLs, and `USD_IDR_RATE` are present; the Next.js dev server starts successfully with `.env` loaded. Google OAuth, Upstash Redis, Resend, Midtrans, and MaxMind values are still marked with explicit `__MISSING_*__` sentinels because real provider credentials were not available in the shell or repo.

**Files Changed:**
- `.env` — Created local ignored environment file with generated `AUTH_SECRET`, Neon database URL, app defaults, and sentinel placeholders for unavailable vendor credentials.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Added implementation progress entries for Phase 0 setup work.

**Decisions Made:**
- Used sentinel values instead of fake-looking credentials for missing external providers so unresolved integrations fail visibly.
- Kept `.env` local-only because `.gitignore` already excludes `.env*`.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Dev server: `rtk bun run dev` — Next.js 16.2.4 started successfully on `http://localhost:3000`.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ❌ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Failed because the script uses `next lint`, which is not valid for this Next.js 16 setup.
- ❌ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — Failed because no Vitest test files exist yet.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Provider credentials were not present for Google OAuth, Upstash, Resend, Midtrans, or MaxMind → Left explicit sentinels in `.env`; these must be replaced with real dashboard values.
- `next lint` script is incompatible with the current Next.js version → Needs a follow-up script update, likely to Biome as documented by the project.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ `.env*` is ignored by Git.
- ✅ `AUTH_SECRET` is generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- ✅ Missing vendor secrets are not fabricated.
- ⚠️ External provider credentials still need to be supplied before related features are safe to exercise.

**Next Task:** 0.1 — Environment Setup (replace remaining `__MISSING_*__` provider credentials)

### 0.2 — Database Setup
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 19:44 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 10 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Verified that `DATABASE_URL` resolves to a Neon-hosted PostgreSQL connection. Ran the Drizzle schema push and verified the expected public tables exist in the database.

**Files Changed:**
- `.env` — Contains the active Neon `DATABASE_URL` used by Drizzle.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Added database setup verification details.

**Decisions Made:**
- Verified tables through `information_schema.tables` instead of launching `db:studio`, because a direct database query gives a deterministic CLI result for this setup task.
- Treated Drizzle's successful push output as necessary but not sufficient, then verified the table list directly.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Database: `rtk bun run db:push` — Completed with `Changes applied`.
- ✅ Schema verification: direct Neon query — Found `users`, `links`, `link_pages`, `smart_rules`, `click_events`, `campaigns`, `split_tests`, `split_test_variants`, `subscriptions`, `transactions`, and `settings`.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial `.env` had a missing `DATABASE_URL` sentinel → Resolved after the environment was hydrated with the Neon connection string.
- `db:studio` was not launched because the required table verification was completed by direct SQL metadata query.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Database connection string remains in ignored `.env`, not source code.
- ✅ Schema was pushed through Drizzle ORM tooling.
- ✅ No raw SQL was added to the codebase.

**Next Task:** 0.3 — Redis Setup

### 0.1 — Environment Setup
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:06 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 10 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Revalidated the completed `.env` after the remaining provider credentials were supplied. All required variables are now present, and the Next.js development server starts successfully with the completed environment.

**Files Changed:**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded completion of the previously partial environment setup task.

**Decisions Made:**
- Verified secret presence by length only to avoid leaking sensitive values in terminal output or journal notes.
- Kept the local `.env` file out of Git and did not print raw provider credentials.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Env validation: all required variables are present with no remaining `__MISSING_*__` sentinels.
- ✅ Dev server: `rtk bun run dev` — Next.js 16.2.4 started successfully on `http://localhost:3000`.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed in the prior Phase 0 verification run.

**Issues Encountered:**
- None after the remaining provider credentials were supplied.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Secret values were masked during validation.
- ✅ `.env*` remains ignored by Git.
- ✅ No secret values were written to tracked source files.

**Next Task:** 0.3 — Redis Setup

### 0.3 — Redis Setup
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:06 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 5 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Verified the Upstash Redis connection using the application's Redis client. Confirmed `ping` returns `PONG`, then wrote, read, and deleted a temporary health-check key.

**Files Changed:**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded Redis setup verification.

**Decisions Made:**
- Tested Redis through `src/lib/redis/index.ts` so the check exercises the same client configuration used by the app.
- Used a temporary expiring key under a health-check namespace and deleted it after verification.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Redis: `redis.ping()` — Returned `PONG`.
- ✅ Redis cache: `redis.set()` then `redis.get()` — Returned `ok`.
- ✅ Cleanup: temporary Redis key deleted after verification.

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Upstash URL and token were not printed.
- ✅ Temporary Redis key contained no sensitive data.
- ✅ Redis credentials remain in ignored `.env`.

**Next Task:** 0.4 — CI/CD Pipeline

### 0.4 — CI/CD Pipeline
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:10 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 35 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Added a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs install, lint, typecheck, test, build, and an optional Vercel deployment hook on pushes to `main`. Fixed the broken lint script and cleaned up current lint blockers so the workflow reflects checks that pass locally.

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Added CI pipeline with Bun setup, lint, typecheck, test, build, and optional Vercel deployment hook.
- `package.json` — Changed `lint` from removed `next lint` command to `eslint .`.
- `tests/unit/db-schema.test.ts` — Added schema smoke test covering required public table exports.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx` — Removed unused icon import.
- `src/components/dashboard/app-header.tsx` — Replaced mount state effect with `useSyncExternalStore` to satisfy React lint rules.
- `src/components/dashboard/app-sidebar.tsx` — Replaced internal `<a>` navigation with Next.js `Link` and removed unused import.
- `src/hooks/use-mobile.ts` — Reworked viewport subscription with `useSyncExternalStore`.
- `src/lib/auth/index.ts` — Narrowed `token.id` before assigning it to the session user.
- `src/lib/db/index.ts` — Removed explicit `any` from DB proxy access.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded CI/CD implementation progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Used ESLint CLI because the project already had ESLint 9 and Next's flat config installed, while `next lint` is not valid in this Next.js 16 setup.
- Added safe CI placeholder env values so build-time imports do not require production secrets, while real deployments can use GitHub secrets and vars.
- Made the Vercel hook optional at runtime so CI remains useful before `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` is configured.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 1 test passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.

**Issues Encountered:**
- `next lint` no longer works for this app setup → Replaced with `eslint .`.
- Existing lint blockers would have failed CI → Fixed narrow issues without changing feature behavior.
- No test files existed, causing Vitest to fail → Added a small schema test rather than weakening the test command.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Workflow uses GitHub `secrets`/`vars` for real credentials and only non-sensitive placeholders as fallbacks.
- ✅ Workflow permissions are restricted to `contents: read`.
- ✅ Vercel deployment hook URL is never hardcoded.
- ✅ No raw secrets were added to tracked files.

**Next Task:** Phase 1.1 — Auth Middleware

### 1.1 — Auth Middleware
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:14 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 25 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented the auth gate for dashboard surfaces using NextAuth's `auth` wrapper and the Next.js 16 `proxy.ts` convention. Unauthenticated users visiting protected dashboard routes are redirected to `/login` with a `callbackUrl`, while auth routes, static assets, and public routes remain accessible.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/proxy.ts` — Added NextAuth-backed route protection and matcher exclusions for auth/static paths.
- `src/lib/auth/protected-routes.ts` — Added protected route matching helper for dashboard routes.
- `tests/unit/protected-routes.test.ts` — Added unit coverage for protected and public route matching.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded auth middleware task progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Used `src/proxy.ts` instead of `src/middleware.ts` because this project runs Next.js 16 and the build warns that the middleware filename convention is deprecated.
- Protected both future `/dashboard/*` paths and the dashboard paths that currently exist at root-level URLs, such as `/links`, `/analytics`, and `/settings`.
- Left `/` public because the project has a root public page and Phase 9 requires a public landing page.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 2 files passed, 3 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: unauthenticated `GET /links` via `rtk curl -I` — Returned `307` to `/login?callbackUrl=%2Flinks`.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: `GET /api/auth/session` — Returned `200`, confirming auth route exclusion.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Next.js 16 emitted a deprecation warning for `src/middleware.ts` → Moved the implementation to `src/proxy.ts`.
- Current dashboard route group exposes pages at root-level paths, not `/dashboard/*` → Covered both route shapes in the matcher helper.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Unauthenticated dashboard access is redirected before page rendering.
- ✅ Auth endpoints are excluded from proxy protection.
- ✅ Static asset paths and file requests are excluded from proxy matching.
- ✅ Callback URL preserves the original protected path without accepting an external URL.

**Next Task:** 1.2 — Register Page

### 1.2 — Register Page
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:16 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 30 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Added a `/register` page with email, password, and confirm password fields, client-side Zod validation, loading state, field-level errors, and API error handling. Successful submissions post to `/api/v1/auth/register` and redirect to `/verify?email=...`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(marketing)/register/page.tsx` — Added register form UI, loading/error states, API submit, toast, and verify redirect.
- `src/lib/validations/auth.ts` — Added strict register validation schema and inferred input type.
- `tests/unit/register-validation.test.ts` — Added unit tests for valid input, invalid email, weak password, and password mismatch.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded register page implementation progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Put validation in `src/lib/validations/auth.ts` so the same schema can be reused by the future register API route.
- Required both a letter and a number in the password to align with the security checklist, even though the task only listed minimum length.
- Included `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` on the state-changing request to align with the CSRF hardening guidance.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 3 files passed, 7 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed and `/register` is generated.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: `GET /register` — Returned `200`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- `/api/v1/auth/register` is not implemented yet, so the form cannot complete a real registration until Task 1.6.
- `/login` and `/verify` are linked/redirected but not implemented yet; those are upcoming Phase 1 tasks.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Input validated with strict Zod schema before submit.
- ✅ Password confirmation is never sent to the API.
- ✅ Request uses JSON content type and `X-Requested-With` header.
- ✅ API error messages are handled without logging submitted credentials.

**Next Task:** 1.3 — Email Verification

### 1.3 — Email Verification
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:18 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 30 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Added a `/verify` page that accepts the `?email=` query parameter, collects a 6-digit OTP, auto-submits when 6 digits are entered, supports resend with cooldown, and redirects to `/login?verified=true` on success. The page uses a Suspense wrapper so `useSearchParams()` stays compatible with App Router static builds.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(marketing)/verify/page.tsx` — Added server wrapper and Suspense fallback for the verification page.
- `src/app/(marketing)/verify/verify-email-form.tsx` — Added client-side OTP form, resend flow, cooldown timer, loading states, and API error handling.
- `src/lib/validations/auth.ts` — Added strict email verification schema.
- `tests/unit/verify-validation.test.ts` — Added verification validation tests for valid and invalid OTP input.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded email verification task progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Used one numeric OTP input with `inputMode="numeric"` and auto-submit on 6 digits for a simpler, mobile-friendly flow.
- Kept resend cooldown client-side for UX; server-side rate limiting remains required in Task 1.7.
- Included `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` on verify and resend requests for consistency with CSRF hardening guidance.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 4 files passed, 9 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed and `/verify` is generated.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: `GET /verify?email=user%40example.com` — Returned `200`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- `/api/v1/auth/verify` and `/api/v1/auth/resend-otp` are not implemented yet, so submit/resend cannot complete until Task 1.6.
- `/login` redirect target is not implemented yet; that is Task 1.4.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Email and OTP are validated with strict Zod schema before submit.
- ✅ OTP input strips non-digits client-side and caps length at 6.
- ✅ API requests send JSON and `X-Requested-With`.
- ✅ Verification failures are surfaced without logging OTP or email values.

**Next Task:** 1.4 — Login Page

### 1.4 — Login Page
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:20 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 25 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Added a `/login` page with email/password credentials sign-in, Google OAuth sign-in, verified-account success state, invalid credentials handling, and a forgot-password link. Credentials login uses NextAuth's client `signIn` with `redirect: false` so errors can be shown inline.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/(marketing)/login/page.tsx` — Added server wrapper and Suspense fallback for the login page.
- `src/app/(marketing)/login/login-form.tsx` — Added client-side login form, Google sign-in button, loading/error states, and callback URL handling.
- `src/lib/validations/auth.ts` — Added strict login validation schema.
- `tests/unit/login-validation.test.ts` — Added login validation tests.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded login page implementation progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Defaulted post-login navigation to `/links` because the current dashboard pages are mounted at root-level dashboard paths, while `/dashboard` does not exist yet.
- Preserved incoming `callbackUrl` so protected-route redirects return the user to the page they requested.
- Used NextAuth's existing Credentials and Google providers instead of adding a custom login API endpoint.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 5 files passed, 12 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed and `/login` is generated.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: `GET /login?verified=true` — Returned `200`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- The installed `lucide-react` package does not export `Chrome` → Used a generic login icon for the Google button.
- `/forgot-password` is linked but not implemented because password reset is outside the current checklist section.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Login input validated with strict Zod schema before submit.
- ✅ Password is never logged or persisted in client state beyond the controlled form.
- ✅ Inline auth errors avoid exposing account enumeration details beyond the planned states.
- ✅ Callback URL is sourced from the middleware-generated query or defaults to an internal dashboard path.

**Next Task:** 1.5 — Google OAuth

### 1.5 — Google OAuth
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:21 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 10 minutes
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial

**What I Did:**
Verified that the completed environment exposes a Google provider through NextAuth and that the local callback URL resolves to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`. Confirmed `/api/auth/providers` returns both `google` and `credentials` providers.

**Files Changed:**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded Google OAuth verification status.

**Decisions Made:**
- Did not mark the task complete because a true end-to-end OAuth test requires an interactive Google consent flow and a Google Cloud OAuth client that has the exact callback URL authorized.
- Kept the login page's Google button wired through NextAuth so the browser flow can be tested as soon as Google Cloud Console is confirmed.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Provider discovery: `GET /api/auth/providers` — Returned `google` and `credentials`.
- ✅ Callback URL shape: computed callback is `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.
- ⬜ E2E OAuth: pending interactive browser sign-in and Google Cloud Console callback confirmation.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Direct `GET /api/auth/signin/google` is not a valid substitute for the NextAuth browser/client sign-in flow in this setup → Used provider discovery instead.
- Cannot confirm Google Cloud Console configuration from the local repository alone.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Google client secret was not printed.
- ✅ OAuth provider credentials remain in ignored `.env`.
- ✅ Callback URL is same-origin with the local app URL.

**Next Task:** 1.6 — API Routes: Auth

### 1.6 — API Routes: Auth
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:26 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 55 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented `POST /api/v1/auth/register`, `POST /api/v1/auth/verify`, and `POST /api/v1/auth/resend-otp`. Added shared API response helpers, OTP helpers, and a Resend email wrapper for verification code delivery.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/v1/auth/register/route.ts` — Added registration validation, duplicate email check, bcrypt password hashing, OTP creation, user insert, and verification email send.
- `src/app/api/v1/auth/verify/route.ts` — Added email/OTP validation, expiry check, and email verification update.
- `src/app/api/v1/auth/resend-otp/route.ts` — Added resend validation, OTP regeneration, email send, and safe success for missing/verified users.
- `src/lib/api/response.ts` — Added standard success/error response helpers with `requestId`.
- `src/lib/auth/otp.ts` — Added OTP generation and expiry helpers.
- `src/lib/email/auth-emails.ts` — Added Resend-backed verification email sender.
- `src/lib/validations/auth.ts` — Added server register schema and resend OTP schema.
- `tests/unit/otp.test.ts` — Added OTP helper tests.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded auth API route implementation progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Used a separate `registerApiSchema` so the API never accepts or stores `confirmPassword`.
- Lowercased emails in shared validation to keep lookups and uniqueness consistent.
- Roll back the inserted user if Resend fails during initial registration email delivery.
- Treated resend for missing or already verified users as success to reduce account enumeration.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 6 files passed, 15 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed and auth API routes are generated.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: invalid register/verify/resend payloads — Each returned `400`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Resend SDK returns `{ data, error }` rather than always throwing → Updated email wrapper to throw when `error` is present.
- Full successful registration was not executed to avoid creating a real user and sending an email during setup verification.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ API inputs validated with strict Zod schemas.
- ✅ Password hashing uses bcrypt cost factor 12.
- ✅ Standard error responses include `requestId`.
- ✅ Password confirmation is not accepted by the API.
- ✅ Missing/verified resend responses avoid confirming account existence.

**Next Task:** 1.7 — Rate Limiting

### 1.7 — Rate Limiting
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:26 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 20 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented a Redis-backed sliding-window rate limiter and applied it to register, credentials login, and OTP resend flows. The limiter uses sorted sets, removes expired entries, counts current window usage, and returns `retryAfter` when limited.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/redis/rate-limit.ts` — Added reusable sliding-window limiter.
- `src/app/api/v1/auth/register/route.ts` — Applied `3/IP/hour` registration limit.
- `src/app/api/v1/auth/resend-otp/route.ts` — Applied `3/email/hour` OTP resend limit.
- `src/lib/auth/index.ts` — Applied `5/IP/15min` Credentials login limit.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded rate limiting implementation progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Used Redis sorted sets instead of fixed counters so the implementation is a real sliding window.
- Kept limiter failures fail-open with server-side error logging so transient Redis issues do not fully lock users out of auth flows.
- Applied login limiting inside the NextAuth Credentials provider because the project uses NextAuth's built-in auth route rather than a custom login API.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 6 files passed, 15 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Runtime smoke: auth API invalid payload checks still return `400` with limiter active.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Login rate limiting needed to be wired into NextAuth provider logic rather than middleware because credential validation happens inside `authorize`.
- Sliding-window limiter integration was not stress-tested to avoid intentionally polluting Upstash with repeated auth attempts.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Register is limited by IP.
- ✅ Credentials login is limited by IP.
- ✅ OTP resend is limited by normalized email.
- ✅ Redis rate-limit keys contain no passwords, OTPs, or tokens.
- ✅ Limited responses include retry timing without exposing sensitive state.

**Next Task:** 1.8 — Auth Tests

### 1.5 — Google OAuth Callback Configuration
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 20:55 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 5 minutes
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial

**What I Did:**
Updated the implementation checklist after the Google Cloud Console authorized callback URL was configured. The configured local callback is `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`.

**Files Changed:**
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Marked Google Cloud Console callback configuration as complete while leaving E2E OAuth testing unchecked.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded Google OAuth callback configuration progress.

**Decisions Made:**
- Kept Task 1.5 as partial because the end-to-end Google consent flow still needs to be tested interactively.
- Did not change application code because the NextAuth Google provider and callback URL shape were already present.

**Tests:**
- ⬜ E2E OAuth: pending interactive Google browser sign-in.

**Issues Encountered:**
- None for checklist update.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Callback URL remains same-origin for local development.
- ✅ No Google OAuth secrets were written to tracked files.

**Next Task:** 1.5 — Google OAuth end-to-end browser test

### 1.8 — Auth Tests
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 21:23 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 45 minutes
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial

**What I Did:**
Added focused unit coverage for password hashing and JWT/session token mapping, then added an integration test for register → verify → credentials login → protected-route matching. Refactored auth internals into small testable helpers while preserving NextAuth as the runtime auth entrypoint.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/auth/password.ts` — Added bcrypt password hash/verify helpers.
- `src/lib/auth/request-ip.ts` — Added shared request IP extraction helper.
- `src/lib/auth/credentials.ts` — Added testable credentials authorization with rate limit, password verification, and verified-email enforcement.
- `src/lib/auth/session-token.ts` — Added testable JWT/session mapping helpers.
- `src/lib/auth/index.ts` — Reused the new credentials and token/session helpers from NextAuth config.
- `src/app/api/v1/auth/register/route.ts` — Reused shared password hashing and request IP helpers.
- `src/app/(marketing)/login/login-form.tsx` — Displayed the custom unverified-email credentials error code.
- `vitest.config.ts` — Added Vitest alias resolution for `@/*` imports.
- `tests/unit/password.test.ts` — Added password hashing and verification tests.
- `tests/unit/session-token.test.ts` — Added token/session mapping tests.
- `tests/integration/auth-flow.test.ts` — Added mocked auth flow integration tests.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Checked off completed unit and integration auth test items.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded this progress entry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Kept E2E unchecked because full browser auth still requires an end-to-end session flow and Google OAuth remains pending interactive sign-in.
- Used `@auth/core/errors` for the custom credentials error so unit/integration tests do not need to load the NextAuth runtime module.
- Enforced verified email before credentials login; the custom code only appears after credentials are valid.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Unit: `rtk bun run test` — 9 files passed, 21 tests passed.
- ✅ Integration: `tests/integration/auth-flow.test.ts` — register → verify → login helper → protected route passed.
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Scoped lint: changed auth/test/config files passed ESLint.
- ⚠️ Full lint: `rtk bun run lint` failed on pre-existing dirty `src/components/landing/landing-page.tsx` issues unrelated to this auth task.
- ⬜ E2E: full browser auth flow pending.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Vitest could not load `next-auth` runtime from the credentials helper → Resolved by importing `CredentialsSignin` from `@auth/core/errors`.
- Full lint is blocked by unrelated local landing-page edits that already existed before this task → Left untouched to avoid overwriting user work.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Password hashing uses bcrypt cost factor 12 through the shared helper.
- ✅ Credentials login remains rate-limited by IP.
- ✅ Credentials login now requires verified email after valid password verification.
- ✅ OTP values are only asserted through mocked test state and are not logged.
- ✅ No raw SQL or secrets were added.

**Next Task:** 1.8 — Auth E2E flow / 1.5 — Google OAuth end-to-end browser test

### 1.8 — Auth E2E Flow
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 21:38 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0 hours 55 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Completed the browser E2E coverage for the credentials auth flow: unauthenticated dashboard access redirects to login, registration creates an OTP, email verification succeeds, login creates a session, and the user reaches `/links`. Tightened dashboard markup issues found during the E2E run so the tested dashboard route no longer emits nested interactive-element hydration warnings.

**Files Changed:**
- `playwright.config.ts` — Aligned E2E base URL and NextAuth URL handling on `localhost`.
- `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` — Stabilized the auth flow test with register-page wait, exact password selectors, credentials callback wait, and dashboard assertion.
- `src/components/dashboard/app-sidebar.tsx` — Used render props for sidebar links and account dropdown trigger to avoid nested interactive elements.
- `src/components/dashboard/app-header.tsx` — Rendered breadcrumb separators as list-item siblings instead of nested list items.
- `src/app/(dashboard)/links/page.tsx` — Used render prop for the row action dropdown trigger to avoid nested buttons.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Declared smooth scroll behavior on `<html>` for the existing global smooth-scroll CSS.
- `src/components/landing/landing-page.tsx` — Removed unused animation code and replaced loose icon prop types with `LucideIcon` so full lint passes.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Checked off the Auth E2E item.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded this completion entry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Kept Google OAuth E2E separate because it still requires an interactive Google consent flow and provider account access.
- Used the existing file-only E2E email capture path instead of adding a public test API endpoint for OTP retrieval.
- Cleaned E2E test users and related auth rate-limit keys after each run to avoid persistent test data and flaky rate limits.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit/Integration: `rtk bun run test` — 9 files passed, 21 tests passed.
- ✅ E2E: `rtk bun run test:e2e` — 1 Playwright test passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Playwright initially filled the login form before the register navigation finished → Added an explicit `/register` URL wait.
- Password label matched both password and confirm password fields → Switched password selectors to exact label matching.
- NextAuth returned/navigated through `localhost` while the test used `127.0.0.1` → Standardized the E2E base URL on `localhost`.
- Dashboard E2E surfaced nested `<button>` and `<li>` hydration warnings → Fixed the relevant sidebar, breadcrumb, and link-table trigger markup.
- Full lint failed on committed landing page code after the branch advanced → Removed unused imports/code and typed icon props with `LucideIcon`.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ E2E OTP capture uses local file delivery only outside production.
- ✅ Test user is deleted after the E2E flow.
- ✅ Auth rate-limit keys used by the E2E flow are cleaned up.
- ✅ No secrets or OTPs are printed in test output.
- ✅ No raw SQL was added; cleanup uses Drizzle.

**Next Task:** 1.5 — Google OAuth end-to-end browser test, or Phase 2.1 — Create Link API if OAuth interaction remains unavailable.

### 2.1 — Create Link API
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 21:49 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0h 25m
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented `POST /api/v1/links` with session auth, strict Zod validation, SSRF-safe destination URL checks, tiered link-creation rate limits, free/pro/business quota checks, custom-slug plan gating, duplicate slug handling, generated 7-character slugs, and standard API responses with `shortUrl`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/v1/links/route.ts` — Added authenticated create-link API route.
- `src/lib/db/queries/links.ts` — Added Drizzle query helpers for user plan, quota count, slug lookup, and link insert.
- `src/lib/validations/link.ts` — Added create-link schema, slug validation, and destination URL safety checks.
- `src/lib/links/limits.ts` — Added plan quotas, rate limits, and custom-slug gating helper.
- `src/lib/links/slug.ts` — Added random slug generator.
- `tests/integration/create-link-api.test.ts` — Added route behavior coverage for success, auth, validation, duplicate slug, plan gating, quota, and rate limit.
- `tests/unit/link-validation.test.ts` — Added slug and destination URL validation coverage.
- `tests/unit/slug.test.ts` — Added slug generator coverage.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Checked off Task 2.1.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/SECURITY.md` — Marked link-create-specific rate limit, slug validation, and destination URL validation items complete.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded this completion entry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Free users can create random short links only; custom slugs return `PLAN_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`.
- Link quotas follow the billing page limits: Free 25, Pro 500, Business unlimited.
- Destination URLs are normalized before storage and blocked for localhost, private IPv4 ranges, local hostnames, loopback IPv6, ULA, and link-local IPv6.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit/Integration: `rtk bun run test` — 12 files passed, 45 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Security grep: no raw SQL or user-controlled `fetch(req/body/params...)` matches in `src`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Security grep still reports an existing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage in `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`; this task did not add or modify that code.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Input validated with strict Zod schema.
- ✅ Auth required before link creation.
- ✅ Plan-based quota and custom-slug authorization enforced.
- ✅ Tiered Redis rate limiting applied to link creation.
- ✅ Slug uniqueness checked before insert and protected against unique-constraint races.
- ✅ Destination URL SSRF guard blocks unsafe protocols and internal hosts.
- ✅ No raw SQL, secrets, or sensitive logging added.

**Next Task:** 2.2 — List Links API

### 2.2 — List Links API
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 22:06 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0h 20m
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented `GET /api/v1/links` with session auth, strict query validation, plan-based API rate limiting, owner-scoped Drizzle queries, pagination, optional search and campaign filters, and response metadata `{ page, limit, total }`. Each returned link includes a generated `shortUrl`.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/v1/links/route.ts` — Added authenticated list-links API route.
- `src/lib/db/queries/links.ts` — Added paginated owner-scoped list query with optional search/campaign filters and total count.
- `src/lib/validations/link.ts` — Added list query schema for `page`, `limit`, `search`, and `campaignId`.
- `src/lib/links/limits.ts` — Added plan-based general API rate limits.
- `src/lib/api/response.ts` — Added optional `meta` support to success responses.
- `tests/integration/list-links-api.test.ts` — Added route coverage for success, defaults, auth, query validation, unknown params, and rate limiting.
- `tests/integration/create-link-api.test.ts` — Updated query mock for the expanded links query module.
- `tests/unit/link-validation.test.ts` — Added list query validation tests.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Checked off Task 2.2.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/SECURITY.md` — Updated implemented-so-far Zod API input coverage.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded this completion entry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Default pagination is `page=1`, `limit=20`; `limit` is capped at 100 to protect query cost.
- Unknown query params are rejected instead of silently ignored.
- List queries are scoped by `session.user.id` in the Drizzle filter, so users only receive their own links.
- Search covers slug, destination URL, and title using parameterized Drizzle predicates.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit/Integration: `rtk bun run test` — 13 files passed, 54 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Next runtime diagnostics: `get_errors` on port 3000 returned no config/session errors.
- ✅ Security grep: no raw SQL, user-controlled fetch, or obvious async loop/N+1 patterns in `src`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Query params validated with strict Zod schema.
- ✅ Auth required before returning user data.
- ✅ Ownership enforced by filtering every list query with authenticated `userId`.
- ✅ Tiered API rate limiting applied to list endpoint.
- ✅ Pagination cap protects database workload.
- ✅ No raw SQL, secrets, or sensitive logging added.

**Next Task:** 2.3 — Get/Update/Delete Link API

### 2.3 — Get/Update/Delete Link API
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 22:13 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0h 30m
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` for `/api/v1/links/[id]` with UUID param validation, session auth, ownership checks, plan-based API rate limiting, detail response with click summary, destination/title/slug updates, duplicate slug handling, custom-slug plan gating, and soft delete behavior.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/v1/links/[id]/route.ts` — Added detail, update, and delete route handlers.
- `src/lib/db/queries/links.ts` — Added link detail lookup, owned update, and soft-delete query helpers.
- `src/lib/validations/link.ts` — Added link ID params schema and update body schema.
- `tests/integration/link-item-api.test.ts` — Added route coverage for detail, IDOR, update, duplicate slug, free-plan slug denial, invalid destination, empty body, soft delete, auth, and invalid ID.
- `tests/unit/link-validation.test.ts` — Added update input validation coverage.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Checked off Task 2.3.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/SECURITY.md` — Updated ownership, IDOR, Zod, and destination URL validation status.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded this completion entry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Soft delete uses `isActive=false` because the current database schema does not have a `deletedAt` column; adding a new column would require a schema migration outside this task.
- Another user's link returns `403 FORBIDDEN`, matching the SECURITY.md direct object reference requirement.
- `GET` returns `clickSummary.totalClicks` from the link's maintained `clickCount`; full analytics remains scoped to Task 2.6.
- Empty string title in PATCH clears the title to `null`; omitted fields are left unchanged.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit/Integration: `rtk bun run test` — 14 files passed, 66 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Next runtime diagnostics: `get_errors` on port 3000 returned no config/session errors.
- ✅ Security grep: no raw SQL, user-controlled fetch, or obvious async loop/N+1 patterns in `src`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- The schema lacks a dedicated deleted marker, so soft delete currently maps to `isActive=false`.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Params and update body validated with strict Zod schemas.
- ✅ Auth required before item access, update, or delete.
- ✅ Ownership checked explicitly before returning, updating, or deleting a link.
- ✅ IDOR test verifies cross-user access returns 403.
- ✅ Tiered API rate limiting applied to item endpoints.
- ✅ Destination URL updates use the SSRF guard.
- ✅ No raw SQL, secrets, or sensitive logging added.

**Next Task:** 2.4 — Redirect Handler

### 2.4 — Redirect Handler
- **Date:** 2026-05-06 22:37 GMT+7
- **Duration:** 0h 35m
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

**What I Did:**
Implemented the public `/{slug}` handler with Redis-first lookup, PostgreSQL fallback, active/scheduled/expiry gating, public Link Page rendering, permanent redirect fallback, and async fire-and-forget click logging. Added redirect cache invalidation when a link is updated or soft-deleted.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx` — Added public slug handler, Link Page renderer, cache lookup, availability checks, and redirect path.
- `src/lib/links/redirect.ts` — Added public slug validation, redirect availability checks, cache key helper, and cache payload conversion.
- `src/lib/db/queries/links.ts` — Added minimal public redirect and Link Page query helpers.
- `src/lib/analytics/click-logger.ts` — Added minimal click event insert for referrer and user agent.
- `src/app/api/v1/links/[id]/route.ts` — Invalidates redirect cache after updates and soft deletes.
- `tests/unit/redirect.test.ts` — Added redirect helper coverage.
- `tests/unit/click-logger.test.ts` — Added click logger success/failure coverage.
- `tests/integration/link-item-api.test.ts` — Added cache invalidation assertions for update/delete.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Checked off Task 2.4.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/SECURITY.md` — Updated Link Page JSX escaping and public slug validation status.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/JOURNAL.md` — Recorded this completion entry.

**Decisions Made:**
- Redirect cache TTL is 300 seconds to keep Redis-hit redirects fast while limiting stale URL exposure.
- Link Page content uses JSX escaping and validates dynamic CTA color as a strict hex value before applying inline style.
- If a link has `hasLinkPage=true` but no Link Page record exists, the handler falls back to redirect rather than breaking the short link.
- The minimal click logger does not store IP address yet; IP hashing, geo lookup, and device parsing remain scoped to Task 2.5.
- Next.js `page.tsx` supports `permanentRedirect`, which returns a permanent 308 redirect. A literal 301 response would require a route handler instead of the requested page file.

**Tests:**
- ✅ Typecheck: `rtk bun run typecheck` — Passed.
- ✅ Lint: `rtk bun run lint` — Passed.
- ✅ Unit/Integration: `rtk bun run test` — 16 files passed, 75 tests passed.
- ✅ Build: `rtk bun run build` — Passed.
- ✅ Browser verification: loaded `/not-a-real-slug` in Playwright and received the expected 404 page.
- ✅ Next runtime diagnostics: `get_errors` on port 3000 returned no config/session errors after browser session cleanup.
- ✅ Security grep: no raw SQL, user-controlled fetch, or obvious async loop/N+1 patterns in `src`.

**Issues Encountered:**
- A test caught that the old slug could be lost if the link object is mutated during update; fixed by snapshotting the old slug before update and invalidating both old/new cache keys.
- Security grep still reports the existing `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage in `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`; this task did not add or modify that code.

**Security Checks:**
- ✅ Public slug params validated with the same lowercase alphanumeric/hyphen rules as link creation.
- ✅ Inactive, expired, and future-scheduled links return 404 before redirect/render.
- ✅ User-generated Link Page text is rendered through JSX, not raw HTML.
- ✅ No plaintext IP collection added before Task 2.5 hashing work.
- ✅ Redis cache invalidated after link update/delete.
- ✅ No raw SQL, secrets, or sensitive logging added.

**Next Task:** 2.5 — Click Logging
